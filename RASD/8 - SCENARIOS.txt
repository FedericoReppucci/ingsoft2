1) Yesterday Betty brought her car to the mechanic for changing the front tires. Today she needs to go to the supermarket, approximately 5km far away. Through PowerEnJoy mobile application installed on her smartphone, she reserves a car parked just 200 meters away. 
Arrived at the car, she unlocks it and enters into it and in 10 minutes she reaches the supermarket.

TRANFER STUDENT

Giulia has come from her hometown Pescara to Milano to attend university, and since her family could not afford to buy another car just for her, she tought that her effort towards obtaining a driving 
license would have gone to waste. Her new friends tell her that she should consider registering to a car sharing service, and so after a bit of search on the web she reads about PowerEnJoy. The curiosity
towards electric powered cars and the potential benefits that the service could provide to her daily life lead her to decide to register to the service, so she downloads the app to her sartphone and installs it. 
After starting the app a sign in/sign up screen appears, so she selects the sign up option and starts filling in the required information. 
After double-checking that her identity card's number and her Codice Fiscale are typed correctly, as well as the data of her driving license, she proceeds to the next step of the regisration process.
At this point the system asks Giulia o provide a valid credit card to associate to her account. Luckily her parents just recently gave her a visa credit card for her living expenses, so she promptly 
inserts the credit card number and CVV. The  system replies confirming that the payment information she provided are indeed valid, and so her registration is almost complete:
upon agreeing to the terms of servicea confirmation e-mail is sent to her,  she opens her mail box and she writes down the password that the system has sent her, and than tries to log in the applicaion.
The e-mail and password provided are correct and so Giulia can start using PowerEnJoy.
