PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The PowerEnJoy project aims to develop a car-sharing service run exclusively employing electric cars.
The system will provide a platform available both as a desktop and mobile application by means of which
the users, once registered, will be able to utilize the car sharing services.

The registration requires the user to provide a valid e-mail address and a valid driving license (of type B or higher), as
well as to select one of the available payment methods. //more specific once the payment methods will be decided
After the verification of the provided data, an e-mail will be sent to the user containing a password that will be used to access
the platform.

Any registered user will be able to see on a map of the city the available cars within a certain radius either from their current position or
from a selected address. By clicking on an available car on the map the user will be able to reserve it. The reserved car can be then unlocked
either via the appropriate function on the mobile app or by providing a pin code obtained through the reservation. //to be revised

A pre-defined set of safe areas will be available for parking the cars, as well as a number of power grid stations to recharge them.  

The main goals of the service are to provide a sustainable and envoronmentally-friendly car sharing service as well as to promote virtuous 
behaviors from its users: a number of discounts will be applied to users who carry more than two passengers, leave the car with more than half 
of if its battery left or park it near to a power grid and take care of plugging it in. On the other hand, users who leave
the car more than three kilometers away from the nearest power grid or leave it with less than 20% of its battery will be charged for an additional
amount.
