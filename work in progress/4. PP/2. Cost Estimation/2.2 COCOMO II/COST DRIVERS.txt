  A system failure can at most cause the loss of a small amount of money. For instance during the failure, an user could not be able to reserve a car or the payment procedure could not be well performed.

  DataBaseSize(DATA) ***
  The DATA cost driver is obtained by calculating the ratio of bytes in the testing database to SLOC in the program.
  In the testing database we assume that each field, being always raw data (string, dates, identifiers, numbers, booleans), can takes up at most 20byte. This is a pessimistic upper bound that can be usefull for a quick estimate of the testing database size.
  We consider to have:
  - 100 users: each user, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 18 = 360byte
  - 10 ride/user: each ride, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 5 = 100byte
  - 10 reservation/user: each reservation, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 5 = 100byte
  - 20 cars: each car, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 9 = 180byte
  - 20 retrieval requests: each retrieval requests, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 5 = 100byte
  - 20 employee: each employee, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 6 = 120byte
  - 1000 payments: each payment, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 9 = 180byte
  - 100 profile stats: each profile stats, considering all its fields, takes up at most 20byte * 3 = 60byte

  //TODO WEEEEEEEEBBBBB SITEEEEE
 
  The safe area is mainly a collection of points. Each point has 2 coordinates. Each coordinate we can suppose takes up 8byte.
  We consider to have 100 point the describe the edges of poligons: the total occupied size is 100 * 8 * 2 byte = 16000byte

  The total size is: 446KB
  From the functional point, the SLOC is: 

  Hence, the ratio DBbyte/SLOC is: 446000/

Execution Time Constraint (TIME)

This is a measure of the execution time constraint imposed upon a software system. The rating is expressed in terms of the percentage of available execution time expected to be used by the system or subsystem consuming the execution time resource. The rating ranges from nominal, less than 50% of the execution time resource used, to extra high, 95% of the execution time resource is consumed.
