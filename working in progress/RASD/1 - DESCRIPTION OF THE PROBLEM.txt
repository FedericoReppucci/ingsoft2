DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM

The PowerEnJoy project aims to develop a car-sharing service run exclusively employing electric cars.
The system will provide a platform available both as a desktop and mobile application by means of which
the users, once registered, will be able to use the car sharing services.

The registration requires the user to provide a valid e-mail address, telephone number and a valid driving license (of type B or higher), as well as some personal information and valid credit card data. 
After the verification of the provided data, an e-mail will be sent to the user containing a password that will be used to access the platform.

Any registered user will be able to see on a map of the city the available cars within a certain radius either from their current position or from a selected address. By clicking on an available car on the map the user will be able to reserve it. The reserved car can be then unlocked via the appropriate function on the mobile app.

A pre-defined set of safe areas will be available for parking the cars. A number of these areas will also have power grid stations, providing a mean to recharge the cars.  

The main goals of the service are to provide a sustainable and environmentally-friendly car sharing service as well as to promote virtuous behaviours from its users: a number of discounts will be applied to users who carry more than two passengers, leave the car with more than half of if its battery full or park it near to a power grid and take care of plugging it in. On the other hand, users who leave the car more than three kilometers away from the nearest power grid or leave it with less than 20% of its battery will be charged for an additional amount.
