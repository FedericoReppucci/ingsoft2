The following class diagram wants to show which are and how are connected the main information that the system tracks.
The system has saved records both for users and employees. For each user (in addition to his/her personal information) the system tracks his/her reservations and rides. For each ride, for example, the system keeps track the duration time and the start/ending position.
On the other hand for the employee is important to know which cars he/she has retrieved, when and where.
The system knows also which are the safe areas, with which it can control if a car is well parked (in a safe area) or not.
